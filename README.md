## 📌 Project Overview

This project identifies fraudulent transactions using **unsupervised clustering** with **DBSCAN**.  
Without needing labeled data, it detects frauds based on **density anomalies**, and evaluates them against real labels.

Visual inspection using **PCA** and metrics like **Silhouette Score** and **Confusion Matrix** validate the model.

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

- ✅ **Silhouette Score**: Measures cluster compactness and separation.
- 📉 **Confusion Matrix**: Evaluates predictions vs actual frauds.
- 📋 **Classification Report**: Includes precision, recall, and F1-score.

> 📍 High **precision**: Most predicted anomalies were actual frauds.  
> ⚠️ Moderate **recall**: Common in unsupervised anomaly detection, as some frauds may not appear as clear outliers.
